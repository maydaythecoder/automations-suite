    "volume": 60,
    "keywords": ["github", "stackoverflow", "dev", "code", "programming", "vscode", "cursor", "terminal"],
    "description": "Upbeat music for coding sessions"
  },
  "focus": {
    "playlist_uri": "spotify:playlist:YOUR_ACTUAL_FOCUS_PLAYLIST_ID", 
    "volume": 40,
    "keywords": ["docs", "reading", "research", "learning", "documentation", "tutorial", "medium"],

node music/smart-music-controller.js status
node music/smart-music-controller.js config

# Start smart music
node music/smart-music-controller.js start
```

## üéØ Your Current Context Detection

Based on your current tabs, the system will detect:

- **Coding Context**: When you have GitHub, VS Code, Cursor, or localhost tabs open
- **Focus Context**: When reading docs, tutorials, or research
- **Meeting Context**: When Zoom, Meet, Teams, or calendar tabs are active
- **Creative Context**: When design tools like Figma are open
- **Default Context**: For general work

## üöÄ Quick Commands

Once set up, you can use these commands:

```bash
# Start smart music automation
"Start smart focus music"

# Manual switches
"Switch to coding music"
"Switch to focus music"

# Check status
"What's my current music context?"
